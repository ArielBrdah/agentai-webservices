# Virtual Agent Management API

## Description
Backend API built with **NestJS** to manage virtual agents. This application allows users to create, delete, update, list, and retrieve virtual agents that have been trained. 

The application is structured into four main modules:
- **Agents**: Manage virtual agents.
- **Auth**: Handle user authentication and authorization.
- **Chat**: Interact with virtual agents through a chat interface.
- **Prompt**: Manage prompts for training and interactions.

### Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete virtual agents.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Secure the API with an authentication layer.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable and maintainable codebase.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight and portable database solution.
